# New concepts

As per request by schools director the following changes are being made

## Restrictions

Web application may now only be accessible to school students with an account in local network.

## Access

Students log in with their local account by a prompt when entering a website to gain access.
We will no longer store any information (this includes passwords or user accounts) except for contact information assosciated with an offer in order to allow / provide a way for users to communicate.

## Authentication & Authorization

User is required to provide their email in order to set up new offer.
This way we can have a way to assign this offer to a person and also allow them to manage their offer.
If user wants to manage their offers they have to login using email that they used to make an offer with and since we are making it all without passwords, the confirmation access code will be sent via email.

## Offers

Offers can no longer have any images nor descriptions due to legal reasons.

Although this might change in future if someone decides to improve this project by adding an AI for text detection and verification.

We are limiting students to have only maximum of 10 (ten) active offers at a time. User can not create new offer if they have 10 offers pending.
